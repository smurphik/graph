This is only a workpiece, which will probably need to be changed for specific tasks. However, it may be convenient to import the original version of the module without copying it into the current directory.

    $ cd `place for permanent keeping this module`
    $ git clone https://github.com/smurphik/graph
    $ cd graph
    $ sudo pip3 install -e .
